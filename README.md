<h1 align="center">📦 Distributed Mining System with Load Balancing</h1>

<p align="justify">
This project implements a <b>distributed mining system</b> designed to simulate <b>block mining</b> with load balancing across multiple servers. The system uses a <b>client-server architecture with UDP protocol</b> and includes a <b>Load Balancer</b> that distributes mining tasks efficiently. The application ensures data integrity by using <b>hashing techniques</b> that require discovering a <b>nonce value</b> that meets specific criteria (e.g., generating a hash with a defined number of leading zeros).

<h2>🚀 Project Components</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>🖥️ Client:</b> Sends mining requests to the Load Balancer.</li>
  <li><b>⚖️ Load Balancer:</b> Dynamically assigns mining ranges to available servers.</li>
  <li><b>🔎 Servers:</b> Mine the required hash values in parallel to boost performance.</li>
  <li><b>📊 Execution Time Analysis:</b> Evaluates system scalability and the effectiveness of load balancing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔑 Key Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>✅ Efficient <b>load balancing</b> for mining tasks.</li>
  <li>✅ <b>Parallel processing</b> to accelerate the nonce discovery process.</li>
  <li>✅ Comprehensive <b>performance analysis</b> based on mining difficulty and number of clients.</li>
  <li>✅ Clear code structure with <b>detailed comments</b> for improved readability.</li>
</ul>
